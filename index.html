            <h3 class="content__author">By Naman Singhal</h3>
            <p>In the desert outside of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a man wearing nothing but his underwear and a gas mask
                erratically drives an RV down a desolate highway. In the passenger seat, another man is passed out, also
                wearing a gas mask. In the back of the RV are two bodies. After crashing the RV in a ditch, the drivers
                climbs out, dons a shirt handing from the side view mirror, and retrieves a video camera and gun from
                the vehicle. Recording a message on the camera, the man identifies himself as Walter White and bids a
                cryptic farewell to his wife and son as sirens are heard in the distance. Walt then walks onto the road
                and awaits the apparent approach of police, gun in hand.</p>
            <p>Three weeks earlier, on his 50th birthday, Walt wakes up before dawn and exercises while contemplating of
                a plaque on his wall commemorating his contributions to research that won a Nobel Prize. At breakfast,
                his pregnant wife, Skyler, hands him a plate of eggs topped by veggie bacon spelling out "50". They
                banter with their handicapped son, Walt Jr., who complains about the veggie bacon. Afterwards, Walt
                drops off Junior at J. P. Wynne High School, where Walt also works as a chemistry teacher. In class,
                Walt explains to his apathetic students how he regards chemistry as the study of change as well as
                matter.</p>

            <p>The following day, Walt steals boxes full of chemistry equipment from his high school, while Jesse
                arranges to buy a used RV so that will be used as the duo's mobile meth lab. Upon driving into the
                desert, Walt strips down to his underwear (so as not to contaminate his clothes with chemical odors) and
                cooks his first batch of crystal methamphetamine. Jesse is astonished with the chemical purity of the
                product Walt has produced.</p>
            <blockquote>Yo, yo, yo! 1-4-8-3 to the 3 to the 6 to the 9. representin' the ABQ. What up, Biatch? Leave at
                the tone.</blockquote>
            <p>Jesse takes a sample of Walt's meth to Krazy-8, a mid-level drug distributor who happens to be the cousin
                of his Jesse's partner, Emilio Koyama. Emilio, who was arrested in Hank's bust and is now out on bail,
                believes that Jesse ratted him out. The three then drive out to the RV, where Krazy-8 asks Walt if he
                wants to switch allegiances. Before he can answer, Emilio recognizes Walt from the bust and begins
                threatening him. Jesse tries to flee, but trips and knocks himself out on a rock. Walt barters for his
                life by promising to reveal his meth formula. </p>
